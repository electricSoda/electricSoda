#### Something about me
**I've been coding since 2016, so you do the maths. I haven't learned much, but I have created some ambitious projects.
Ever since I created these public profiles I've been really dumb about my security, so that's why some of my repositories are private.**

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on a video game crypto-currency called **SodaCoin**. Website can be found at (https://soda-coin.herokuapp.com/)[https://soda-coin.herokuapp.com/]
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning **Java** for minecraft plugins (I don't find other languages like Ruby, Clojure, C++, etc. very useful ATM).
- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: **we/us** (very mature)
- âš¡ Fun fact: **The average person walks by almost 16 murderers in their lifetime.**

#### Anways thanks for stopping by.
